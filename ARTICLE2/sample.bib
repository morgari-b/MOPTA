abstract = {A review of more than 60 studies (plus m4ore than 65 studies on P2G) on power and energy models based on simulation and optimization was done. Based on these, for power systems with up to 95% renewables, the electricity storage size is found to be below 1.5% of the annual demand (in energy terms). While for 100% renewables energy systems (power, heat, mobility), it can remain below 6% of the annual energy demand. Combination of sectors and diverting the electricity to another sector can play a large role in reducing the storage size. From the potential alternatives to satisfy this demand, pumped hydro storage (PHS) global potential is not enough and new technologies with a higher energy density are needed. Hydrogen, with more than 250 times the energy density of PHS is a potential option to satisfy the storage need. However, changes needed in infrastructure to deal with high hydrogen content and the suitability of salt caverns for its storage can pose limitations for this technology. Power to Gas (P2G) arises as possible alternative overcoming both the facilities and the energy density issues. The global storage requirement would represent only 2% of the global annual natural gas production or 10% of the gas storage facilities (in energy equivalent). The more options considered to deal with intermittent sources, the lower the storage requirement will be. Therefore, future studies aiming to quantify storage needs should focus on the entire energy system including technology vectors (e.g. Power to Heat, Liquid, Gas, Chemicals) to avoid overestimating the amount of storage needed.}

abstract = {Hydrogen technologies can play an important role in decarbonising our energy system in a variety of ways across the energy value chain. It is therefore critical to identify the strategic roles as well as the conditions under which hydrogen energy systems become attractive for the energy transition. In this paper, the authors present a techno-economic review of hydrogen energy systems including power-to-power, power-to-gas, hydrogen refuelling and stationary fuel cells. We focus on their optimal operation as flexible assets and we identify three actions that can foster their uptake beyond technological progress. First, we recommend optimal electricity supply with dedicated control strategies considering that electricity dominates the levelised cost of hydrogen production via electrolysis. Secondly, hydrogen can enable the further integration of traditionally independent sectors, namely electricity, heat and transport while contributing to decarbonise all. This position can also be advantageous for investors who sell heat and fuels as energy efficient products. Lastly, we examine a whole range of revenues from different products and applications which can be combined (i.e. benefit stacking) to match capital and operational expenditures. We discuss these roles in depth and we conclude that policy makers together with technology developers should elaborate smart strategies to reduce cost by scaling production, stimulate standardisation (e.g., similar to the PV industry) as well as develop new market structures and regulatory frameworks which allow hydrogen technologies to deliver multiple low carbon applications and products.}

Applying right timing can maximize the performance of the supply. The optimal operation of a wind turbine, a solar unit, a fuel cell and a storage battery is searched by a mixed-integer linear programming implemented in General Algebraic Modeling Systems (GAMS). A Virtual Power Producer (VPP) can optimal operate the generation units, assured the good functioning of equipment, including the maintenance, operation cost and the generation measurement and control. A central control at system allows a VPP to manage the optimal generation and their load control. The application of methodology to a real case study in Budapest Tech, demonstrates the effectiveness of this method to solve the optimal isolated dispatch of the DC micro-grid renewable energy park. The problem has been converged in 0.09s and 30 iterations.}

abstract = {Energy system models play an important role in evaluating potential pathways to a low-carbon energy system. Modeling the electrical grids within an energy system model raises the computational burden significantly. This is the reason why the grid is often reduced to a lower amount of nodes. While grid reduction is common in energy system models, the partitioning of the grid is mostly done manually. A grid reduction method is proposed that takes electrical parameters of the grid as well as other parameters, such as political borders or region-specific renewable potentials, into account. The proposed reduction method uses clustering based on electrical distance to identify regions with high electrical connectivity to minimize load flow deviations after the reduction. The method is compared against another state-of-the-art partitioning-based reduction method. The comparison shows that the partitioning plays an important role on the accuracy of line power flows when reducing grids for energy system analysis. An additional investigation is carried out on the ratio of recognized overloaded lines in the reduced grids. With respect to studied parameters, the proposed reduction method prevails. The findings can thus be used to more accurately reduce and represent electrical grids in energy system models.}

abstract = {Mathematical optimization problems including a time dimension abound. For example, logistics, process optimization and production planning tasks must often be optimized for a range of time periods. Usually, these problems incorporating time structure are very large and cannot be solved to global optimality by modern solvers within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, the so-called rolling-horizon approach is often adopted. This approach aims to solve the problem periodically, including additional information from proximately following periods. In this paper, we first investigate several drawbacks of this approach and develop an algorithm that compensates for these drawbacks both theoretically and practically. As a result, the rolling-horizon decomposition methodology is adjusted to enable large scale optimization problems to be solved efficiently. In addition, we introduce conditions that guarantee the quality of the solutions. We further demonstrate the applicability of the method to a variety of challenging optimization problems. We substantiate the findings with computational studies on the lot-sizing problem in production planning, as well as for large-scale real-world instances of the tail-assignment problem in aircraft management. It proves possible to solve large-scale realistic tail-assignment instances efficiently, leading to solutions that are at most a few percent away from a globally optimal solution.}

abstract = {This paper presents the development and demonstration of a limited foresight energy system model. The presented model is implemented as an extension to a large, linear optimization model, MESSAGE. The motivation behind changing the model is to provide an alternative decision framework, where information for the full time frame is not available immediately and sequential decision making under incomplete information is implied. While the traditional optimization framework provides the globally optimal decisions for the modeled problem, the framework presented here may offer a better description of the decision environment, under which decision makers must operate. We further modify the model to accommodate flexible dynamic constraints, which give an option to implement investments faster, albeit with a higher cost. Finally, the operation of the model is demonstrated using a moving window of foresight, with which decisions are taken for the next 30 years, but can be reconsidered later, when more information becomes available. We find that the results demonstrate some of the pitfalls of short term planning, e.g. lagging investments during earlier periods lead to higher requirements later during the century. Furthermore, the energy system remains more reliant on fossil based energy carriers, leading to higher greenhouse gas emissions.}

The hybrid model (Beta-PSO-LSTM) of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and Beta distribution function based particle swarm optimization (PSO) is put forward for prediction interval of wind power. In order to enhance the performance of the Beta-PSO-LSTM for PIWP in training process, wind power series are divided into different power intervals, and then the Beta-PSO-LSTM is used to estimate each power interval of the original wind power series. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the interval forecasting error information in wind power training data set, Beta distribution model is proposed to get better PIWP, and PSO is used to optimize the parameters of the model. Finally, the proposed Beta-PSO-LSTM model is compared with the Beta distribution optimized by PSO based the BP neural network (Beta-PSO-BP), the normal distribution based LSTM neural network (Norm-LSTM), Beta distribution based LSTM neural network (Beta-LSTM), and Beta distribution optimized by iterative method based LSTM neural network (Beta-IM-LSTM) for PIWP. The simulation results show that the PIWP obtained by the Beta-PSO-LSTM model has higher reliability and narrower interval bandwidth, which can provide decision support for the safe and stable operation of power systems.}

abstract = {Pakistan is currently experiencing an acute shortage of energy and urgently needs new sources of affordable energy that could alleviate the misery of the energy starved masses. At present the government is increasing not only the conventional energy sources like hydel and thermal but also focusing on the immense potential of renewable energy sources like; solar, wind, biogas, waste-to-energy etc. The recent economic crisis worldwide, global warming and climate change have also emphasized the need for utilizing economic feasible energy sources having lowest carbon emissions. Wind energy, with its sustainability and low environmental impact, is highly prominent. The aim of this paper is to explore the wind power production prospective of one of the sites in south region of Pakistan. It is worth mentioning here that this type of detailed analysis is hardly done for any location in Pakistan. Wind power densities and frequency distributions of wind speed at four different altitudes along with estimated wind power expected to be generated through commercial wind turbines is calculated. Analysis and comparison of 5 numerical methods is presented in this paper to determine the Weibull scale and shape parameters for the available wind data. The yearly mean wind speed of the considered site is 6.712m/s and has power density of 310W/m2 at 80m height with high power density during April to August (highest in May with wind speed 9.595m/s and power density 732W/m2). Economic evaluation, to exemplify feasibility of installing wind turbines, is also done. The estimated cost of per kWh of electricity from wind is calculated as 0.0263US$/kWh. Thus the candidate site is recommended for some small stand-alone systems as well as for wind farm.}

It contains 6001 lines (alternating current lines at and above 220 kV voltage level and all high voltage direct current lines), 3657 substations, a new open database of conventional power plants, time series for electrical demand and variable renewable generator availability, and geographic potentials for the expansion of wind and solar power. The model is suitable both for operational studies and generation and transmission expansion planning studies. The continental scope and highly resolved spatial scale enables a proper description of the long-range smoothing effects for renewable power generation and their varying resource availability. The restriction to freely available and open data encourages the open exchange of model data developments and eases the comparison of model results. A further novelty of the dataset is the publication of the full, automated software pipeline to assemble the load-flow-ready model from the original datasets, which enables easy replacement and improvement of the individual parts. This paper focuses on the description of the network topology, the compilation of a European power plant database and a top-down load time-series regionalisation. It summarises the derivation of renewable wind and solar availability time-series from re-analysis weather datasets and the estimation of renewable capacity potentials restricted by land-use. Finally, validations of the dataset are presented, including a new methodology to compare geo-referenced network datasets to one another.}

This paper reports the first international validation of reanalysis for wind energy, testing NASA's MERRA and MERRA-2 in 23 European countries. Both reanalyses suffer significant spatial bias, overestimating wind output by 50% in northwest Europe and underestimating by 30% in the Mediterranean. We derive national correction factors, and show that after calibration national hourly output can be modelled with R2 above 0.95. Our underlying data are made freely available to aid future research. We then assess Europe's wind resources with twenty-year simulations of the current and potential future fleets. Europe's current average capacity factor is 24.2%, with countries ranging from 19.5% (Germany) to 32.4% (Britain). Capacity factors are rising due to improving technology and locations; for example, Britain's wind fleet is now 23% more productive than in 2005. Based on the current planning pipeline, we estimate Europe's average capacity factor could increase by nearly a third to 31.3%. Countries with large stakes in the North Sea will see significant gains, with Britain's average capacity factor rising to 39.4% and Germany's to 29.1%.}

abstract = {Solar PV is rapidly growing globally, creating difficult questions around how to efficiently integrate it into national electricity grids. Its time-varying power output is difficult to model credibly because it depends on complex and variable weather systems, leading to difficulty in understanding its potential and limitations. We demonstrate how the MERRA and MERRA-2 global meteorological reanalyses as well as the Meteosat-based CM-SAF SARAH satellite dataset can be used to produce hourly PV simulations across Europe. To validate these simulations, we gather metered time series from more than 1000 PV systems as well as national aggregate output reported by transmission network operators. We find slightly better accuracy from satellite data, but greater stability from reanalysis data. We correct for systematic bias by matching our simulations to the mean bias in modeling individual sites, then examine the long-term patterns, variability and correlation with power demand across Europe, using thirty years of simulated outputs. The results quantify how the increasing deployment of PV substantially changes net power demand and affects system adequacy and ramping requirements, with heterogeneous impacts across different European countries. The simulation code and the hourly simulations for all European countries are available freely via an interactive web platform, www.renewables.ninja.}

The hybrid model (Beta-PSO-LSTM) of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and Beta distribution function based particle swarm optimization (PSO) is put forward for prediction interval of wind power. In order to enhance the performance of the Beta-PSO-LSTM for PIWP in training process, wind power series are divided into different power intervals, and then the Beta-PSO-LSTM is used to estimate each power interval of the original wind power series. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the interval forecasting error information in wind power training data set, Beta distribution model is proposed to get better PIWP, and PSO is used to optimize the parameters of the model. Finally, the proposed Beta-PSO-LSTM model is compared with the Beta distribution optimized by PSO based the BP neural network (Beta-PSO-BP), the normal distribution based LSTM neural network (Norm-LSTM), Beta distribution based LSTM neural network (Beta-LSTM), and Beta distribution optimized by iterative method based LSTM neural network (Beta-IM-LSTM) for PIWP. The simulation results show that the PIWP obtained by the Beta-PSO-LSTM model has higher reliability and narrower interval bandwidth, which can provide decision support for the safe and stable operation of power systems.}

% % abstract = {Pakistan is currently experiencing an acute shortage of energy and urgently needs new sources of affordable energy that could alleviate the misery of the energy starved masses. At present the government is increasing not only the conventional energy sources like hydel and thermal but also focusing on the immense potential of renewable energy sources like; solar, wind, biogas, waste-to-energy etc. The recent economic crisis worldwide, global warming and climate change have also emphasized the need for utilizing economic feasible energy sources having lowest carbon emissions. Wind energy, with its sustainability and low environmental impact, is highly prominent. The aim of this paper is to explore the wind power production prospective of one of the sites in south region of Pakistan. It is worth mentioning here that this type of detailed analysis is hardly done for any location in Pakistan. Wind power densities and frequency distributions of wind speed at four different altitudes along with estimated wind power expected to be generated through commercial wind turbines is calculated. Analysis and comparison of 5 numerical methods is presented in this paper to determine the Weibull scale and shape parameters for the available wind data. The yearly mean wind speed of the considered site is 6.712m/s and has power density of 310W/m2 at 80m height with high power density during April to August (highest in May with wind speed 9.595m/s and power density 732W/m2). Economic evaluation, to exemplify feasibility of installing wind turbines, is also done. The estimated cost of per kWh of electricity from wind is calculated as 0.0263US$/kWh. Thus the candidate site is recommended for some small stand-alone systems as well as for wind farm.}
